Core Deliverables
As a user:

1. When the app starts, I can see all listings.
2. I can "favorite" and "unfavorite" a listing on the frontend by clicking the star icon. This feature doesn't need backend persistence.
3. I can remove a listing from the page by clicking the trash can icon. This change should be persisted in the backend.
4. I can search for listings by their name.
